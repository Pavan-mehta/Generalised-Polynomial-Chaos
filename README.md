# Generalised-Polynomial-Chaos
Non Intrusive Generalised Polynomial Chaos

This is a Fortran 90 code which can be complied in any standard Fortran complier such a gfortran (my personal favourite), NAG or Siverfrost

This code is for an univariate non - intrusive Generalised Polynomial Choas Technique, also known as Stoachastic Collocation Method 

While this is for an univariate case it can be readily extended to multivariate case. 

The test function used here is F(x) = cos (x); x in RADIANS. However, you can change it as per your will, even taking real world data

I'm a Thermo-fluids Engineer not a fulltime programmer. Hence, this code may not be efficient but it does the job :)

My name is Pavan Mehta, I wrote this while my MSc Dissertation at The University of Manchester, UK in summer 2016. Needless to mention validated as well

I hope you find it usefull. Please don't hesitate to contact me, I'll try my best to answer your queries.
